- We need to display products based on the combination between selected category & all applied filters.
- The boundaries and the options of filters are unknown and to be determined from data after the initial loading.
- We need to load the initial data first & determine the boundaries and the options of each filter before displaying them.
- On the selection of a category or filter, we map through all products and filter out any product that doesn't match all selections.
- This implementation is applied in "useProducts" hook, which listens for changes in the state of all the inputs and returns the filtered products.
- The solution is solely based on frontend.
- This approach is based on functional programming, so it is predictable and readable as it follows the declarative paradigm of React.
- The downside is that on every selection or change no matter how small that change is, we apply the filtering function on all loaded products.
